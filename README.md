anne-lib
========

A small, clever library that provides data structures source-compatible with glib, with a more permissive license.

I spent quite some time writing a 2D game engine in C, utilizing glib for its internal data structures. This proved to be a mistake because the LGPL is not compatible with many closed App Stores. While this is assuredly not a software problem, it currently appears that writing a drop-in replacement for gLib is substantially easier than talking large software companies into relaxing their standards.
